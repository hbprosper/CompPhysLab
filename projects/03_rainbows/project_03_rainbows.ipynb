    "When light strikes the boundary between two media of differing refractive index the light is partially reflected and partially transmitted. If there are no energy losses, then the incident light energy is shared between the reflected and transmitted light. A rainbow is a beautiful example of this physical effect.\n",
    "A rainbow is formed when droplets of water in the atmosphere separate sunlight into the colors **red**, **orange**, **yellow**, **green**, **blue**, **indigo**, and **violet** (ROYGBIV). To see a rainbow, you must look away from the Sun towards the droplets of water, and the angle between a ray from the Sun and a ray from a droplet (called $\\phi$ in the figure) must be of a certain value. From the figure \n",
    "<img src=\"fig10_water_droplet2.png\" align=\"left\" alt=\"water droplet\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "and the geometry of a circle, you should be able to convince yourself that\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    \\phi & = 4 \\theta_t - 2 \\theta_i ,\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\theta_i$ is the **angle of incidence** and $\\theta_t$ is the **angle of transmission**, which in this case is also the **angle of refraction**. A light wave can be represented by a ray that gives the direction of the wave and by the direction of the oscillating electric field, which is always at right angles to the ray. This way of representing a light wave is called **ray optics**. Only three rules \n",
    "are needed to implement ray optics assuming no energy loss:\n",
    "  1. The angle of reflection $\\theta_r$ is equal to the angle of incidence $\\theta_i$.\n",
    "  1. The angle of transmission $\\theta_t$ (otherwise known as the angle of refraction) satisfies **Snell's Law**, \n",
    "  \n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  n_2 \\sin\\theta_t  & = n_1 \\sin\\theta_i ,\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n_1$ is the refractive index of the medium through which the incident ray travels and $n_2$ is the refractive index of the medium containing the transmitted (refracted) ray. By convention, all angles are measured with respect to the normal $\\hat{n}$ to the boundary. (Note: The normal can point in the direction shown or in the opposite direction.) \n",
    "  1. The fractions of reflected light is given by the [Fresnel equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_equations)\n",
    "  \\begin{align}\n",
    "      R_S & = \\left( \\frac{n_1 \\cos\\theta_i - n_2 \\cos\\theta_t}{n_1 \\cos\\theta_i + n_2 \\cos\\theta_t} \\right )^2, \\quad\\text{ and }\\\\\n",
    "      R_P & = \\left( \\frac{n_1 \\cos\\theta_t - n_2 \\cos\\theta_i}{n_1 \\cos\\theta_t + n_2 \\cos\\theta_i} \\right )^2 ,\n",
    "  \\end{align}\n",
    "where the subscripts $S$ and $P$ denote two different directions (**polarizations**) in which the electric field can oscillate:\n",
    "      1. $S$: The electric field oscillates along a line that \"Sticks\" out of the page and is perpendicular to the direction of the ray.\n",
    "      1. $P$: The electric field oscillates along a line that is \"Parallel\" to the page and is perpendicular to the direction of the ray.\n",
    "      \n",
    "A light wave can be represented as an admixture of these two polarization states.\n",
    "The fraction of transmitted light in each polarization state is $T_l = 1 - R_l$, where $l = S, P$. In general, $R_S$ and $R_P$ are not the same. Therefore, reflections and transmissions can alter the polarization state of the light. In this project, we'll assume that the incident sunlight can be represented as an equal admixture of $S$ and $P$ polarized light. We say that the incident light is **unpolarized**. If we choose units such that the light incident on the water has unit intensity, in which case 1/2 is of the $S$ polarization and 1/2 is of the $P$ polarization. Therefore, the fraction of the unpolarized incident light that is reflected at the boundary of the droplet is $R = \\frac{1}{2}R_S + \\frac{1}{2}R_P$, while the fraction that is transmitted is $T = 1 - R$ since we've assumed no energy loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "From Snell's law $n_1 \\sin\\theta_i = n_2 \\sin\\theta_t$, the formula above for $\\phi$ can be rewritten as\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    \\phi & = 4 \\sin^{-1}[(n_1 / n_2) \\, \\sin\\theta_i] - 2 \\theta_i.\n",

    "## The reflection and transmission vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the incident unit vector $\\hat{u}_i$ and the normal vector $\\hat{n}$,  in `01_rainbow.ipynb` it is shown that the reflection and transmission unit vectors, $\\hat{u}_r$, and $\\hat{u}_t$, respectively, are given by \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    \\hat{u}_r & = \\hat{u}_i -2 (\\hat{u}_i \\cdot \\hat{n}) \\hat{n}, \\\\ \\nonumber\\\\\n",
    "    \\hat{u}_t & = b \\, \\hat{n} + (n_1 \\, / \\, n_2) \\, \\hat{n} \\times \\hat{u}_i \\times \\hat{n} , \\text{ where } \\\\\n",
    "    b & = \\text{sign}(\\hat{u}_i \\cdot \\hat{n}) \\sqrt{1 - (n_1 \\, / \\, n_2)^2 (1 - (\\hat{u}_i\\cdot\\hat{n})^2)}.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "The above equations are written entirely in terms of vectors. Therefore, they will work for any orientation of the boundary between two media. They can be used not only for the rainbow problem but for any ray optics problem, for example, propagating rays through an optical instrument. The reflection and transmission unit vectors have been implemented in the `computil` module `computil.vectors`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Write a program to propagate one or more light rays through a droplet for a given number $M$ of reflections at the boundary of the droplet.\n",
    "  1. For $M = 3$, use your program to verify the equation for $\\phi$ by propagating rays with the following angles of incidence: $\\theta_i \\in [45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75]$. Set $\\hat{u}_i = (1, 0, 0)$, set $\\vec{c} = (-4.0, y, 0)$ and choose $y$ appropriately for each angle of incidence.\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Questions\n",
    "  1. For what angle of incidence $\\theta_i$ is the angular separation in $\\phi$ the largest for red and blue light?\n",
    "  1. For that value of $\\theta_i$, what fractions of the incident red and blue light energy reaches your eyes?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "  1. There is no energy loss at a droplet boundary.\n",
    "  1. The refractive indices of red light and blue light in water are **1.33** and **1.34**, respectively.\n",
    "  1. The radius of a droplet is $a = 2.5 \\text{mm}$.\n"
